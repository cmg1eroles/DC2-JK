Answers to questions number 3 and 4:
3. The parts of our original design that were affected were mainly the adding of tasks onto the calendar. Our design was flexible enough to accommodate the option of to-do tasks and still have the same features with the already present event tasks and more. The rest, different panels for different purposes, saving, etc., were added fairly smoothly within our previous design.
4. It depends on what features or functionality that will be added but we think that our calendar can adapt to new changes.
